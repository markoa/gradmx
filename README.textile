University project, integrates use of "Tokyo Cabinet":http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/ / "Tyrant":http://1978th.net/tokyotyrant/ in a Ruby on Rails web application for posting and viewing events and locations. Includes TokyoRecord, a tiny wrapper around "rufus-tokyo":http://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-tokyo for accessing Tokyo Tyrant tables. Tyrant instances are managed with "tyrantmanager":http://github.com/copiousfreetime/tyrantmanager.

h2. Setup

Install Tokyo Cabinet and Tokyo Tyrant. On Ubuntu, you usually need to install this library before that:

<pre><code>apt-get install libbz2-dev</code></pre>

Get the latest sources from the Tokyo website, unpack and do the <code>./configure && make && sudo make install</code> thing.

Install all required gems:

<pre><code>sudo rake gems:install</code></pre>

Copy database.yml and adjust it to your MySQL setup:

<pre><code>cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml</code></pre>

h2. Starting the application

You may wish to generate some fake data:

<pre><code>rake db:bootstrap</pre></code>

There's a script which will tell tyrantmanager to run all the Tyrant instances and boot Mongrel:

<pre><code>./script/launch</code></pre>

One of the Tyrant tables is called Highlights, for simulating the case of serving variable data on a homepage that gets a lot of views. You can populate it with random events with the following rake task:

<pre><code>rake events:highlight</code></pre>
